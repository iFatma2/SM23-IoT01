# SM23-IoT01  

# Introduction
  A key objective of the Internet of Things path 1st task is to connect the robot movement control panel to an electrical circuit connected to 4 LEDs, so that if the robot moves forward, backward, right, left, a specific LED will be on, and when the stop button is pressed, this LED will be turned off.




# The components

   1) ESP32

   2) 4 LEDs

   3) Wires to connect.


 

# The task was completed in: 

  1st Phase: circuit simulation at Wokwi.

  2nd Phase: Representation and operation of the department at headquarters.


 

# The results
